### Requirements
- For back and forward icons to display properly, you must enable `svg.context-properties.content.enabled` in about:config. You also need to set `ui.prefersReducedMotion` to 1 (You may need to create it).
- Classic Theme must be used for the theme to work properly. MSFX was made and designed with Classic Theme and not using it will result to it not working as intended.
- Windows, like it's not obvious. I'm not having plans in making MSFX work on Linux nor macOS. If you have experienced in CSS, feel free to modify MSFX to work more properly under Linux or other operating systems.
- Latest version of Firefox
